===== HTML6.mint =====
THIS PROJECT USES ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE CODE FROM THE REGULAR HTML6 REPOSITORY BY OSCAR GODSON.
ANY FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY THAT ARE EXACT COPIES OF THE FILES FROM GODSON'S REPOSITORY
ARE SIMPLY IGNORED COMPLETELY, AND ARE NOT USED.

I, Oliver Chu, also known as the user "Carrot Lord" on some online communities, and completely rewriting HTML6
in the Mint programming language.

I will NOT be keeping any existing features of HTML6. HTMl6 is a huge experiment, and I only want
my own features for my own version of HTML6.

I will call my version of HTML6 either HTML[6] (with square brackets) or simply HTML6.mint to distinguish
it from the existing HTML6.

The already existing HTML6 repository is available on Github.com. This repository is forked from the
existing one.

Summary: I am erasing this entire README file because I am rewriting all of HTML6 in the Mint language.
I also am not required to license HTML6.mint under the same license as HTML6. Why? Because I am using
absolutely 0.0 percent of the original code from the original HTML6 repository. All of HTML6.mint is my
own personal work.
